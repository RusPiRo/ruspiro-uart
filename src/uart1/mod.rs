//! # Uart1 (miniUart) API
//! 
//! As per the Raspberry Pi peripheral document the miniUART is a lightweight serial communication channel that does only
//! need 3 wires (TX, RX, GND) to be connected to the device. The miniUART is typically used to connect the device to
//! a PC or Mac that runs a terminal console application and is able to display the characters received through this 
//! channel. This allows to pass debug information from the device running the bare metal kernel to improve root cause
//! analysis.
//! 
//! There is no singleton accessor provided for this peripheral as it will be quite likely attached to a ``Console``
//! abstraction that will than **own** this peripheral and should itself providing exclusive access to the inner accessor
//! of the actual device. Please refer to the [``ruspiro-console`` crate](https://crates.io/crates/ruspiro-console).
//!
